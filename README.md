# Object Oriented Programming Practice

Repo just to showcase what I am learning in object-oriented programming. Implemented with Java


## Terminology

- __Class__ - contains instructions for how objects can be created, as well as how objects carry out certain actions
- __Superclass / Parent class__ - a class that has other classes inheriting to it
- __Subclass / Child class__ - a class that inherits from other classes
- __Abstract class__ - a class that can only be extended  
  - Cannot instantiate an instance of an abstract class
  - Only meant to be a parent of another class
- __Interface__ - classes that use an interface are compulsory to implement the methods defined in an interface
